# LAB 1

this is the lab to set up the environment and access the hardware with own image

## Basic Exercise 1 - Basic Initialization - 20%

### Edit the code for booting the system

only use a single cpu core for simplicity
we need to read the register MPIDR_EL1 (64 bit reg) and access the lowest 2 bit to halt all other cores other than one

## Connecting with rpi

use the command `screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200` to connect it
