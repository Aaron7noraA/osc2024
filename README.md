In Lab 0, you need to prepare the environment for future development. You should install the target toolchain, and use them to build a bootable image for rpi3.
Goals of this lab:

* Set up the development environment.
* Understand the concept of cross-platform development.
* Test your rpi3.

### Lab 1: Hello World, Notes
In Lab 1, you will practice bare metal programming by implementing a simple shell. You need to set up mini UART, and let your host and rpi3 can communicate through it.

Goals of this lab:

* Practice bare metal programming.
* Learn how to access rpi3's peripherals.
* Set up the mini UART.
* Set up the mailbox.
