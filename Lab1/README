## About This Project

[Provide a brief description of the project, its goals, and how it's intended to be used. This section can help visitors understand the context and significance of your work.]

## How to Use

This project is organized into several directories, each serving a different purpose. Here's an overview of the key directories:

### Lab1

The `Lab1` directory contains the source code and resources for the first lab assignment. To build the files in this directory, navigate to `Lab1` and type the `make` command:

```bash
cd Lab1
make
```

A `build` directory will appear, containing a `kernel8.img` file. Copy this file along with all the files in `firmware` directory into the SD card.
